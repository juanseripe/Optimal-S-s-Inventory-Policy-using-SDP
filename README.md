# Optimal-S-s-Inventory-Policy-using-SDP
In this project the objective was to find the S and s optimal values to implement the (S,s) inventory management policy.

To find the optimal values, a Stochastic Decision Process was implemented.

The implementation has 8 decision periods, each one with following a uniform distribution with different parameters as shown in the report. The model also allows lost sales.

This implemetation was based on the paper "Optimality of state-dependet (s,S) policies in inventory models with Markov-modulated demand and lost sales" by FENG CHENG and SURESH P. SETHI.
